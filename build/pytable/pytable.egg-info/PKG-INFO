Description: BasicProperty-based RDBMS Wrapper
        
        PyTable provides a schema-based mechanism for constructing
        database-based applications.  Included is a fairly elegant
        SQLQuery object which makes creation of complex SQL in response
        to application requirements somewhat easier, as well as
        classes allowing the modelling of database schemas.
        
        Can read MySQL and PostgreSQL schemas from live databases.
        Can build databases from schemas.
        Does not attempt to abstract away differences in SQL syntax.
        Provides optional object-oriented row-wrappers with
        BasicProperty properties defining fields.
